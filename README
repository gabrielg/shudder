I MADE THE SOMETIMES UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE OF USING GIT SUBMODULES. 

We use Ersatz ( http://github.com/centro/ersatz/tree ), and it's submoduled in.

So if things don't seem to be working right, make sure you did the submodule init/update dance.

RUNNING TESTS:

Have Spidermonkey installed and make sure it's been compiled with JS_HAS_FILE_OBJECT=1

On a Mac:

sudo port install spidermonkey +fileobject
sudo port install javascript-lint (for lint tests)

Run Rake to run the tests
